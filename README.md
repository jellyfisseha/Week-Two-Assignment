# List Operations Exercise üìù

This Python program demonstrates common list operations step-by-step, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and searching elements.

---

## Instructions:

1. Create an empty list called `my_list`.  
2. Append the following elements to `my_list`: 10, 20, 30, 40.  
3. Insert the value 15 at the second position in the list.  
4. Extend `my_list` with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.  
5. Remove the last element from `my_list`.  
6. Sort `my_list` in ascending order.  
7. Find and print the index of the value 30 in `my_list`.  

---

## Code behavior:

After each step, the program prints the current state of `my_list` and shows the final index of `30`.

---

## How to run:

Save the Python script (e.g., `list_operations.py`) and run:

```bash
python list_operations.py
Example Output:

Edit
1. Empty list: []
2. After appending 10, 20, 30, 40: [10, 20, 30, 40]
3. After inserting 15 at index 1: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40]
4. After extending with [50, 60, 70]: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
5. After removing the last element: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
6. After sorting in ascending order: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
7. Index of 30: 3
